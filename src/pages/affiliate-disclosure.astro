      <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">FTC Compliance Disclosure</h3>
      <p>
        ReguMe participates in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program. We earn from qualifying 
        purchases made through our links at no extra cost to you.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Amazon Associates Program</h2>

    <p>
      ReguMe is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising 
      program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking 
      to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        When you click on product links in ReguMe and make a purchase on Amazon, we may earn a small 
        commission at no additional cost to you. The price you pay is the same whether you use our link 
        or go directly to Amazon.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>You pay the same price. We earn a small commission. This helps support ReguMe.</strong>
      </p>
    </div>
